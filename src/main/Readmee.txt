This mini-project focuses on managing student records.
The main functionality I implemented is finding students by their last name.
Additionally, the program includes code for creating new students and reading existing student data,
although these sections have been temporarily commented out for testing purposes.
The project demonstrates basic CRUD operations and simple search functionality in a structured way.
